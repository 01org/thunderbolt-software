Overview 
========
Thunderboltâ„¢ technology is a transformational high-speed, dual protocol 
I/O that provides unmatched performance with up to 40Gbps bi-directional 
transfer speeds. It provides flexibility and simplicity by supporting both 
data (PCIe, USB3.1) and video (DisplayPort) on a single cable connection 
that can daisy-chain up to six devices.

In addition, the Thunderbolt Networking mode allows a connection of two computers 
through a Thunderbolt cable. 

Features
========
The Thunderbolt daemon (thunderboltd) is an user space daemon 
that is part of the Thunderbolt Networking implementation.
The Thunderbolt Networking is shown as an Ethernet connection 
over the Thunderbolt controller. 
The daemon is responsible of the establishment of the communication
link between the computers and its management during its entire lifetime.
The daemon is able to work with any peer computers, no matter which
security level is currently deployed on them. 

Supported OS
============
- Red Hat* Enterprise Linux 7.2
- Ubuntu* 15.10
- SUSE* Linux Enterprise Desktop 12 SP1

Kernel/Daemon Compatibility
===========================
The daemon operates in coordination with the Thunderbolt kernel driver to provide
the Thunderbolt functionalities.
When upgrading to a newer version of the daemon, ensure that a compatible version
of the kernel is used.
By default, same build versions are compatible unless specified.

Known Issues
============
- 4926679: Thunberbolt networking is not set properly
* For systems deploying a "bridge configuration" on Red Hat* Enterprise Linux 7.0
Thunderbolt networking  may not function properly.
* In rare situations, Thunberbolt networking may not established (no Thunderbolt
device eth appears) after a handshake is completed by the two peers;
a further re-plug of the cable will re-establish and create
the eth device.

Resolved Issues
===============
- 4926652: Daemon is not working after initial install
* There's a need to restart the system post-installtion to make the daemon work.
properly

- 4926640: Daemon version logging is inaccurate
* Prints of the version from the daemon logger are not printing right versions.

- 4926767: make install can be run from outside Thunderbolt/Linux folder
* Enter the folder on the build machine and run the make install command from
this location.
