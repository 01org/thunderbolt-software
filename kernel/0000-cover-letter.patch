Subject: [PATCH 0/6] thunderbolt: Introducing Thunderbolt(TM) networking

Thunderbolt(TM) generation 3 provides USB, charging, Display Port and
Thunderbolt connectivity over a single physical port.

Thunderbolt(TM) networking, introduced in these patches, provides the
capability of connecting hosts together by emulating an Ethernet adapter.
It provides the same networking benefits with the advantage of the fast
Thunderbolt medium capabilities.
Thunderbolt(TM) networking is capable of operating in the last position
in the Thunderbolt(TM) device daisy chain.

It is also compatible with Thunderbolt(TM) Networking in OS X and Windows
implementations, and supports both Thunderbolt(TM) generation 2 and 3.

The kernel code operates in coordination with the Thunderbolt(TM)
user-space daemon. Together, they implement full Thunderbolt(TM) networking
functionality.
This implementation runs on ICM (firmware) based 
Thunderbolt(TM) controllers.

Note that the Thunderbolt(TM) Hardware specs have not been published yet and
were partially used for register definitions.
